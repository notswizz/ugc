UGC ON-DEMAND JOB PLATFORM — PRODUCT PLAN

1. Core concept (high level)

This product is a DoorDash-style on-demand marketplace for UGC creation.
	•	Brands post fixed-price UGC Jobs
	•	Creators browse a feed, see payout + urgency, and tap Accept
	•	First valid completion wins (when enabled)
	•	Quality is enforced by Trust Score + AI evaluation
	•	Payments are automatic, fast, and transparent

No applications.
No negotiations.
No waiting.

⸻

2. Mental model
	•	Brands = job posters
	•	Creators = dashers / workers
	•	Jobs = gigs with a fixed payout, deadline, and requirements
	•	Squads = tag-based creator groups that brands can target
	•	Recruiters (Squad Leads) = curators who assemble squads and earn a cut
	•	AI = compliance + quality judge (not taste dictator)

⸻

3. Job types (all jobs look the same)

Every job uses the same layout.
The only thing that changes is the visibility badge.

Visibility types
	•	Open – any creator who meets requirements can accept
	•	Squad – only creators in eligible squads (via tags)
	•	Invite – only invited creators can accept

Badges must be visually obvious and consistent.

⸻

4. “Things”, not brands (core abstraction)

The system is built around things / categories, not brand loyalty.

Examples:
	•	Gambling
	•	NFL
	•	College football
	•	Southern cooking
	•	Mom life
	•	Fitness
	•	Streetwear
	•	Outdoor gear
	•	Mobile apps

Creators opt into things, not brands.

This improves:
	•	Matching
	•	Trust
	•	AI learning
	•	Legal safety
	•	Scalability

⸻

5. Creator profile model

Each creator has three key tag groups:

Interests (what I like)

Used to boost feed ranking.
	•	e.g. Gambling, NFL, Cooking

Experience (what I’m good at)

Used to qualify creators.
	•	Paid ads experience
	•	On-camera
	•	Voiceover
	•	Product demos
	•	POV filming

Hard No’s (what I won’t promote)

Used as hard filters.
	•	Gambling
	•	Alcohol
	•	Politics
	•	Supplements

Creators should never see jobs that violate their hard no’s.

⸻

6. Trust Score (anti-spam backbone)

Every creator has a Trust Score (0–100).

Used to:
	•	Gate access to jobs
	•	Rank creators in feeds
	•	Enable reimbursements and higher payouts

Trust Score inputs
	•	Email + phone verified
	•	Stripe Connect onboarded
	•	Connected socials (TikTok, IG, YouTube, LinkedIn optional)
	•	Platform history:
	•	jobs completed
	•	on-time rate
	•	dispute rate
	•	refund rate
	•	Account age

Low-trust creators cannot:
	•	Accept reimbursement jobs
	•	Accept high-payout jobs
	•	Join high-quality squads

⸻

7. Squads (tag-based curation layer)

A Squad is a curated group of creators built around things + style.

Examples:
	•	Gambling TikTok Squad
	•	Southern Living Moms
	•	College Football Fans
	•	NYC Streetwear POV

Key rules
	•	Squads are defined by tags, not brands
	•	Squads are managed by Recruiters (Squad Leads)
	•	Squads have performance stats (completion rate, avg AI score)
	•	Brands target tags, and matching squads become eligible

⸻

8. Recruiters / Squad Leads

Recruiters:
	•	Build and manage squads
	•	Invite/remove creators
	•	Maintain quality
	•	Help brands fill jobs faster

They do not:
	•	Control payouts
	•	Approve content
	•	Override AI or brand decisions

Recruiter incentives
	•	Earn a % cut from the brand side on completed jobs
	•	Only paid when jobs are successfully completed
	•	Rated by brands based on outcomes

Bad recruiters lose visibility automatically.

⸻

9. Job creation (brand flow)

When creating a job, brands define:

Required
	•	Title
	•	Primary thing/category (e.g. Gambling)
	•	Secondary tags
	•	Deliverables (video/photo/raw)
	•	Base payout
	•	Deadline

Optional
	•	Visibility type: Open / Squad / Invite
	•	Target tags (for squads)
	•	Trust Score minimum
	•	Experience requirements
	•	Competition mode (see below)

⸻

10. Competition model (urgency engine)

Jobs may enable competition mode:

standard
	•	First accept wins
	•	Single creator works the job

first_to_complete
	•	Multiple eligible creators may attempt
	•	Only the first approved submission is paid
	•	Once paid, all other attempts are closed

This drives urgency but must be:
	•	Clearly labeled
	•	Fairly enforced
	•	Locked at payout time

⸻

11. Product in video requirement (real-world constraint)

Some jobs require the physical product to appear in the video.

Two supported modes

A. Reimbursement (MVP default)
	•	Job defines:
	•	reimbursement cap
	•	purchase window (e.g. 24h)
	•	Creator buys product
	•	Creator uploads:
	•	receipt
	•	product photo
	•	OCR + sanity checks run
	•	Reimbursement paid with payout

Rules:
	•	Reimbursement is capped
	•	Reimbursement is fee-free
	•	Only allowed for trusted creators

B. Shipping (invite-heavy)
	•	Brand ships product directly
	•	Deadline starts after delivery
	•	Used for higher-value items

⸻

12. Payments & escrow

Payment model
	•	Brand pays upfront via Stripe Checkout
	•	Funds are captured immediately
	•	Platform tracks balances internally
	•	Creator is paid only after approval

Fee rules
	•	Platform fee applies to base payout
	•	Reimbursements are fee-free
	•	Bonuses are fee-free (configurable later)
	•	Recruiter cut (if any) is paid from brand side

⸻

13. AI evaluation (critical)

AI is split into two layers.

Layer 1: Compliance (binary)

Checks:
	•	Product visible
	•	Required mentions present
	•	Duration correct
	•	Audio clarity
	•	No prohibited content

If compliance fails:
	•	Creator can resubmit (within deadline)
	•	Base pay not locked yet

If compliance passes:
	•	Base pay is guaranteed

⸻

Layer 2: Quality score (0–100)

AI scores:
	•	Hook strength
	•	Lighting/framing
	•	Product clarity
	•	Energy/authenticity
	•	Editing pace

Creators see:
	•	Score
	•	Breakdown
	•	Improvement tips

⸻

14. Bonuses & ranking

Jobs may include a bonus pool.

Bonus logic
	•	Bonus thresholds based on AI score
	•	OR top-ranked submissions (brand-funded)
	•	Bonuses paid after approval window

Example:
	•	80–89 → +$25
	•	90+ → +$50

Bonuses are optional but powerful.

⸻

15. Creator job flow
	1.	See job in feed (boosted by interests)
	2.	Check payout, deadline, badge
	3.	Accept job
	4.	(If required) acquire product
	5.	Upload submission
	6.	AI evaluates
	7.	Brand approves (or auto-approve window)
	8.	Creator paid
	9.	Rating prompt

Fast. Predictable. Addictive.

⸻

16. Brand review rules
	•	Brands can approve or request changes
	•	Change requests are limited (e.g. max 2)
	•	Optional auto-approve if brand is inactive
	•	Brands cannot change payout after acceptance

⸻

17. Ratings & reputation

Creators rated on:
	•	On-time delivery
	•	Compliance
	•	Quality

Recruiters rated on:
	•	Job success rate
	•	Squad quality
	•	Brand satisfaction

Ratings affect:
	•	Feed ranking
	•	Job eligibility
	•	Earnings potential

⸻

18. Admin control

Admins can:
	•	Enable recruiters
	•	Resolve disputes
	•	Override payouts (rare)
	•	Adjust platform fees
	•	Suspend bad actors

All money movement happens via backend functions only.

Rules:
	•	State transitions are Functions-only
	•	UI can never mutate state directly
	•	First paid submission locks job permanently

⸻

20. Non-goals (explicit)

This product does NOT:
	•	Negotiate pricing
	•	Allow open-ended revisions
	•	Let recruiters control payouts
	•	Optimize for influencer follower count alone

It optimizes for:

	•	Quality
	•	Completion

⸻

21. MVP priorities

Must ship with:
	•	Open jobs
	•	Trust Score
	•	AI compliance
	•	Reimbursement
	•	Squad visibility (even if admin-only at first)
